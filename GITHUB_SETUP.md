# üêô GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)** and sign in
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Fill in the details**:
   - Repository name: `elt-dashboard-mvp`
   - Description: `ELT Dashboard MVP - Analytics dashboard for software companies with revenue split analysis`
   - Make it **Public** (for free hosting)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. **Click "Create repository"**

### 2. Connect Your Local Repository

Run these commands in your terminal (in the `/Users/blake/elt-dashboard-mvp` directory):

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/elt-dashboard-mvp.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**

### 3. Verify Upload

After pushing, you should see:
- All your files in the GitHub repository
- The README.md displaying properly
- The DEPLOYMENT.md file available

### 4. Next Steps - Deploy to Production

Once your code is on GitHub, you can deploy:

#### Option A: Vercel + Railway (Recommended)
1. **Frontend**: Connect GitHub repo to Vercel
2. **Backend**: Connect GitHub repo to Railway
3. **Set environment variables** as described in DEPLOYMENT.md

#### Option B: Netlify + Railway
1. **Frontend**: Connect GitHub repo to Netlify
2. **Backend**: Connect GitHub repo to Railway
3. **Set environment variables** as described in DEPLOYMENT.md

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If you get "remote origin already exists":
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/elt-dashboard-mvp.git
```

### If you get authentication errors:
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub CLI: `gh auth login`
- Or use a personal access token instead of password

### If you get "repository not found":
- Double-check your GitHub username
- Make sure the repository was created successfully
- Verify the repository name matches exactly
